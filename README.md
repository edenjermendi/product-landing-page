# Product Landing Page

This is a small project built as part of the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/).

The goal is to create a responsive Product Landing Page that meets the following requirements:

- Contains a header with a logo and navigation links
- Navigation links scroll smoothly to different sections of the page
- Includes an embedded product video
- Contains a form to submit an email address
- Navbar stays fixed at the top of the page
- Uses CSS Flexbox for layout
- Includes at least one media query for responsiveness
- Passes all the user stories and tests provided by freeCodeCamp

## Live Demos

- [See the freeCodeCamp demo project](https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks/) for an example of the expected functionality.  
  > *Note: This project is built from scratch and is not a copy of the demo.*

- [View my interpretation here](https://edenjermendi.github.io/product-landing-page/) — built using the previous example as inspiration, but with my own choices and changes.

## How to Use

[Open my project live via GitHub Pages here.](https://edenjermendi.github.io/product-landing-page/)

> *⚠️ Note: The form action points to a dummy URL for freeCodeCamp testing purposes and does not submit real data.*

## Technologies Used
